## Inspiration 💡
During the GameStop Short Squeeze, some big hedge funds were betting against GameStop stock, thinking they could outsmart the small investors. But then, a bunch of them on a subreddit called WallStreetBets got together. They pushed the stock price way up, causing big losses for the hedge funds.

So this got us thinking: if a group of Redditors could impact a stock price like that, could we possibly predict stock movements by tracking and analyzing their conversations?

## What we did 🍽️
We tried to correlate the sentiment scores with the next day's closing prices. Then created a predictive linear regression model that takes the sentiment score as input and predicts the next day's closing prices as the output.

## Results 📸

We saw a clear trend where higher sentiment scores often led to higher closing prices the next day. It's super interesting and shows there might be something to tracking how people feel on social media.
